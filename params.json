It gives you a programatic interface and DSL for creating, copying, moving, \"rendering\", & deleting files and directories.\r\n\r\nArchitecture's main goal is to become the library of choice for gems like rake\r\nand thor.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing\r\n=====\r\n\r\nUsing the DSL you can:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nrequire \"architecture/dsl\"\r\n\r\narchitecture source: \"old\", destination: \"new\"  do\r\n  # Copy a file or directory:\r\n  copy name: \"README.md\"\r\n\r\n  # Rename a copied file or directory:\r\n  copy name: \"LICENSE\", as: \"COPYRIGHT\"\r\n\r\n  # Render a file:\r\n  # - old/applicaiton.rb\r\n  # module {{module}}\r\n  #\r\n  # end\r\n  copy name: \"application.rb\", context: { module: \"Foobar\" }\r\n  # - new/application.rb\r\n  # module Foobar\r\n  #\r\n  # end\r\n\r\n  # Delete a file or directory:\r\n  delete path: \"app.rb\"\r\n\r\n  # Create a file or directory:\r\n  create path: \"application.rb\"\r\n\r\n  # Anything with the `path` keyword might need scoping:\r\n  create path: source(\"application.rb\")\r\n  # - old/application.rb\r\n\r\n  delete path: destiantion(\"app.rb\")\r\n  # - new/app.rb\r\n\r\n  # Move a file or directory:\r\n  move path: destination(\"application.rb\"), as: destination(\"app.rb\")\r\n  # Write over a file:\r\n  overwrite source: destination(\"application.rb\"), content: \"\\n\"\r\n\r\n  # Append text to a file:\r\n  append source: destination(\"application.rb\"), content: \"end\"\r\n\r\n  # Prepend text to a file:\r\n  prepend source: destination(\"application.rb\"), content: \"class Foobaz\"\r\n\r\n  # Replace content in a file:\r\n  replace source: destination(\"application.rb\"), search: /Foobaz/, content: \"Foobar\"\r\n\r\n  # Change the context of a series of commands:\r\n  within source: File.join(\"lib\", \"foobar\") do\r\n    create name: \"version.rb\", content: \"VERSION = 1.0.0\"\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nInstalling\r\n==========\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem \"architecture\", \"~> 1.0\"\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself with:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install architecture\r\n\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n============\r\n\r\n  1. Fork it\r\n  2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n  3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\r\n  4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n  5. Create new Pull Request\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n=========\r\n\r\n  - 1.0.0: Initial release\r\n\r\n\r\nConduct\r\n=======\r\n\r\nAs contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.\r\n\r\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by participants include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\r\n\r\nProject maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.
